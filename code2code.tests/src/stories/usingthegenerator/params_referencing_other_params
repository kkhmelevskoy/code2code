Story: Params referencing other params

	As a Developer
	I want to have each param value processed by declaration order
	So that I can reference and process previous params values



Scenario: Params referencing other params

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/Generator with Params.generator"
	And I create the template file "generators/Generator with Params.generator/templates/GeneratedFile.txt.ftl" with contents:
	  	${processedParam}
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/Generator with Params.generator/templates.ftl" with contents:
	  	templates/GeneratedFile.txt.ftl=Generated File.txt
	And I create the params configuration file "generators/Generator with Params.generator/params.ftl" with contents:
	  	referencedParam=referenced param
	  	processedParam=${referencedParam?capitalize}
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	And I select the "Generator with Params" generator and click "Next"
	And I finish the "Generate Files" wizard
	Then I will see the file "Generated File.txt" generated with content:
	  	Referenced Param
