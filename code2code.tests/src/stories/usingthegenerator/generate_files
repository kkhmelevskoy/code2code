Story: Generate Files

	As a Developer
	I want to generate files
	So that I speed up development



Scenario: Generate Files

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/File Generator.generator"
	And I create the template file "generators/File Generator.generator/templates/GeneratedFile.txt.txt" with contents:
	  	File content
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/File Generator.generator/templates.txt" with contents:
	  	templates/GeneratedFile.txt.txt=Generated File.txt
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	And I select the "File Generator" generator and click "Next"
	And I finish the "Generate Files" wizard
	Then I will see the file "Generated File.txt" generated with content:
	  	File content
