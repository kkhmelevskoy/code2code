Story: Set templates destinations

	As a Developer
	I want to be able to change the destination of the templates
	So that I can choose the right place to it



Scenario: Set a template destination

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/Generator with unwanted destination.generator"
	And I create the template file "generators/Generator with unwanted destination.generator/templates/TemplateWithUnwantedDestination.txt.ftl"
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/Generator with unwanted destination.generator/templates.ftl" with contents:
	  	templates/TemplateWithUnwantedDestination.txt.ftl=UnwantedFolder/Template with unwanted destination.txt
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	And I select the "Generator with unwanted destination" generator and click "Next"
	And I click "Next" on the "Configure Params" dialog
	And I change the template "templates/TemplateWithUnwantedDestination.txt.ftl" destination to "Template with unwanted destination.txt" on the "Customize Generation" dialog
	And I finish the "Generate Files" wizard
	Then I will see the file "Template with unwanted destination.txt" generated
