Story: Choose files that will be generated

	As a Developer
	I want to choose the files that will be generated
	So that I can avoid generation of the ones I don't need



Scenario: Choose files that will be generated

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/Multiple Files Generator.generator"
	And I create the template file "generators/Multiple Files Generator.generator/templates/File1.txt"
	And I create the template file "generators/Multiple Files Generator.generator/templates/File2.txt"
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/Multiple Files Generator.generator/templates.txt" with contents:
	  	templates/File1.txt=File1.txt
	  	templates/File2.txt=File2.txt
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	And I select the "Multiple Files Generator" generator and click "Next"
	And I click "Next" on the "Configure Params" dialog
	And I uncheck the file "templates/File2.txt" on the "Customize Generation" dialog
	And I finish the "Generate Files" wizard
	Then I will see the file "File1.txt" generated
	And I will see not the file "File2.txt" generated
