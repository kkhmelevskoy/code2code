Story: Log generation to console

	As a Developer
	I want to see the generation log on console
	So that I know what's happening



Scenario: Log generated files to console

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/Generator for log.generator"
	And I create the template file "generators/Generator for log.generator/templates/File1.txt.txt"
	And I create the template file "generators/Generator for log.generator/templates/File2.txt.txt"
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/Generator for log.generator/templates.txt" with contents:
	  	templates/File1.txt.txt=File 1.txt
	  	templates/File2.txt.txt=File 2.txt
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	And I select the "Generator for log" generator and click "Next"
	And I finish the "Generate Files" wizard
	Then I will see the "Console" printed with the content:
	
Processing generator: Generator for log
Generating: templates/File1.txt.txt to File 1.txt
Generating: templates/File2.txt.txt to File 2.txt
Done
