Story: Set description to generators

	As a Generator Developer
	I want to set description to generators
	So that others developers knows its purposes


Scenario: Set a description to a generator

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/Generator with description.generator"
	And I create the template file "generators/Generator with description.generator/templates/Generatorwithdescription.txt.ftl"
	And I create the description file "generators/Generator with description.generator/description.txt" with contents:
	    A generator with a description
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/Generator with description.generator/templates.ftl" with contents:
	  	templates/Generatorwithdescription.txt.ftl=Generator with description.txt
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	And I select the "Generator with description" generator and click "Next"
	Then I will see the "Configure Params" dialog with the description:
	    A generator with a description
