Story: Create Generators

	As a Developer
	I want to create my own generators
	So that I can customize them to my needs


Scenario: Create a minimal do-nothing generator

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/Minimal Generator.generator"
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/Minimal Generator.generator/templates.txt"
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	Then I will see the "Minimal Generator" generator listed on the "Select a Generator" dialog

	
Scenario: Create a generator which just generates a file on the specified location

	Given I have a new project
	When I create the generator folder "generators/Plain File.generator"
	And I create the template file "generators/Plain File.generator/templates/PlainFile.txt" with contents:
	  	Plain Text File!!!
	And I create the templates configuration file "generators/Plain File.generator/templates.txt" with contents:
	  	templates/PlainFile.txt=Plain File.txt
	And I right click the project on the Package Explorer and select "Generate..."
	And I select the "Plain File" generator and click "Next"
	And I finish the "Generate Files" wizard
	Then I will see the file "Plain File.txt" generated with content:
	  	Plain Text File!!!
